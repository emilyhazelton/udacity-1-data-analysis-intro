# Project Summary


For my first Udacity project, I explored data records from the Titanic. 

My tasks were to:

* Produce functional code
* Use NumPy arrays and Pandas Seres and DataFrames
* Generate a question for investigation and explore multiple variables
* Use visualizations to make comparisons and show trends
* Present any limitations of hte analysis
* Produce appropriate and readily interpreted plots
